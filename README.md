# Sanctum Adrift

## Description

The game takes place in a pocket dimension thrown into the void to act as the home and resting place for many types of elemental/arcane spirits. Each type of spirit has a home here, and a society forms from their collective residence. The dimension is however not completely hidden, and many adventurers from other planes often travel to it seeking fame, conquest, wealth, and/or power.



## Features

### Conversations
The core gameplay experiences and mechanics revolve around conversation (and to an extent, general interaction) with NPCs. Conversations are dynamic, conforming to world events and player conversation choices. Conversations may also lead to quests, which are given by certain spirits, and are almost always low-stakes.

### The Player
The player is a newly-born and unique spirit. They have been created for the express purpose of driving out a handfull of particularly annoying adventurers who have taken up residence in most of the dimension's sanctums. They are charged with (peacefully) evicting the pesky loiterers and bringing calm to the spirit home.

When starting the game, the player has the choice between starting as one of the 5 different types. Their starting type grants them ease of speech with others of their type, and a few starting conversation skills. They start at minor class, and can eventually work their way up to magnanimous.

### Game styles
The game forgoes the traditional easy-medium-hard difficulty structure, and instead aims to cater to various individually-preferred playstyles. Special game styles for niche preferences or accessibility reasons are also explored. Game styles can be turned on/off at will at any time during gameplay (except for during special moments)
